[{"categories":["Book","Leadership"],"content":"Over the past few months, I’ve been getting back into the habit of reading books (or listening to them). It’s been a fresh start for me as I’ve picked up a few titles and managed to finish five of them, mostly in the categories of software engineering and leadership. These books are incredibly popular, and you can find plenty of reviews for them online. However, I’ve decided to share a brief overview from my perspective.\nLet’s start with the first one: ‘The Phoenix Project’.\nThe Plot The book carries a captivating subheading: “A Story About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Succeed.” In my opinion, it’s a perfect description that captures the essence of the book.\nThe story kicks off with an unexpected twist as Bill Palmer, the main character, gets promoted to become the VP of IT Operations at Parts Unlimited. This company manufactures car parts and sells them directly to consumers through their own stores, aiming to provide affordable car maintenance. However, in today’s internet and e-commerce era, Parts Unlimited struggles to keep up with competitors. To regain their former success, they take on a project called “Phoenix.” But things aren’t going smoothly - the development, IT operations, business, and marketing teams suffer from poor collaboration. With the company on the verge of being broken apart, Bill must ensure the successful completion of the project “Phoenix” while keeping other crucial applications running smoothly.\nSpoiler alert: the story concludes with a satisfying success! 😉\nConcepts In the way of storytelling, this book presents some insightful concepts. One of which is the classification of tasks we encounter in our daily work:\nPlanned Work: these are business projects that drive towards achieving specific business goals and objectives. Internal Projects: this category encompasses activities aimed at improving internal infrastructure, systems, and processes. Changes: refers to the modifications or updates made to systems, applications, or infrastructure in response to evolving business needs or technological advancements. Unplanned Work: this category involves unexpected incidents, problems, and issues that arise suddenly and demand immediate attention. Another concept is the three way guiding principle towards achieving efficient and effective IT operations:\nThe First Way: understanding and visualizing the flow of work across the entire organization. The Second Way: creating fast and effective feedback mechanisms to enable the timely detection and correction of issues. The Third Way: creating a culture that fosters learning, resilience, and innovation. The book also highlights the importance of having a mentor, which is implicitly emphasized. In the story, Bill finds guidance and support from his mentor, Erik Reid, who helps him navigate and understand the various concepts that I mentioned earlier. Erik plays a crucial role in Bill’s journey, providing insights and knowledge that contribute to his growth and development throughout the book.\nQuotes My most favorite quotes from the book:\n“Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work.”\n“Being able to take needless work out of the system is more important than being able to put more work into the system.”\n“until code is in production, no value is actually being generated, because it’s merely WIP stuck in the system.”\n“Features are always a gamble. If you’re lucky, ten percent will get the desired benefits.”\nWorthwhile? Should you choose to read or listen to this book? Well, that entirely depends on your expectations and personal preferences. From my perspective, it was an incredibly worthwhile investment of both time and money.\nHave you had the chance to read the book? I’d love to hear your feedback and thoughts on it.\n","description":"","tags":["DevOps","Agile","Transformation","Management","Review"],"title":"Book Overview: The Phoenix Project","uri":"/book-overview-the-phoenix-project/"},{"categories":["Python","Flask"],"content":"1st January 2020 was the official sunset date of Python 2. At NewsCred (now Welcome) we had a bunch of services written in Python 2 that we wanted to migrate to Python 3 as soon as we can, since the sunset date was approaching. In late November 2019, my team (Public API) took the first initiative to migrate one Flask service from Python 2.7.9 to 3.8.0. As you can guess, it didn’t go butter smooth, and I’m here to tell the tale.\nThat big migration PR got reviewed by 4 experienced engineers. We had good test coverage. We created integration tests from log replay. We did extensive manual testing before production deployment. But as soon as it hit the production, we started getting PagerDuty alerts!\nA lot of API requests were getting HTTP 500 responses. Without much investigation, out of instinct we reverted the migration PR. Though the frequency went down by a big margin, we were still getting some 500s.\nHere’s Why! From the logs we saw, after the migration PR deployment we started getting the following exception:\n... ... File \"/.../werkzeug/contrib/cache.py\", line 631, in get return self.load_object(self._client.get(self.key_prefix + key)) File \"/.../werkzeug/contrib/cache.py\", line 621, in load_object return pickle.loads(value[1:]) UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 180662: ordinal not in range(128) After the deployment of the revert PR, we got the following exception:\n... ... File \"/...werkzeug/contrib/cache.py\", line 598, in get return self.load_object(self._client.get(self.key_prefix + key)) File \"/.../werkzeug/contrib/cache.py\", line 588, in load_object return pickle.loads(value[1:]) ValueError: unsupported pickle protocol: 4 So the underlying issue was with pickle not being able to de-serialize the cached object. Let’s dive a little deeper.\nCache Setup We used Redis for response caching in that service. The setup looked something like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 from werkzeug.contrib.cache import RedisCache cache = RedisCache(host=config.CACHE_HOST, port=config.CACHE_PORT) cache.set(key, value, timeout=config.CACHE_TIMEOUT) value = cache.get(key) So we used the RedisCache client from the werkzeug. (Underneath it uses the redis-py, this information is not relevant here though).\nWhere Things Went Wrong RedisCache uses pickle to serialize objects before writing to redis:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 def dump_object(self, value): \"\"\"Dumps an object into a string for redis. By default it serializes integers as regular string and pickle dumps everything else. \"\"\" t = type(value) if t in integer_types: return str(value).encode('ascii') return b'!' + pickle.dumps(value) And de-serialize objects after reading from redis:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 def load_object(self, value): \"\"\"The reversal of :meth:`dump_object`. This might be called with None. \"\"\" if value is None: return None if value.startswith(b\"!\"): try: return pickle.loads(value[1:]) except pickle.PickleError: return None try: return int(value) except ValueError: # before 0.8 we did not have serialization. Still support that. return value Implementation of the default pickle protocol in Python 2.7.9:\n1 2 if protocol is None: protocol = 0 And the implementation of the default pickle protocol in Python 3.8.0:\n1 2 if protocol is None: protocol = DEFAULT_PROTOCOL The value of the DEFAULT_PROTOCOL:\n1 DEFAULT_PROTOCOL = 4 And there’s a docstring telling:\nThe optional *protocol* argument tells the pickler to use the given protocol; supported protocols are 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. The default protocol is 4. It was introduced in Python 3.4, it is incompatible with previous versions. As the default protocol of pickle got changed from Python 2 to 3, the cache objects those were serialized (set) using Python 2, couldn’t be de-serialized (get) using Python 3 due to the unicode conversion error.\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 180662: ordinal not in range(128) Thus we were getting that influx of 500s after the migration PR deployment.\nWhile the service was running in Python 3, some data got cached, after reverting to Python 2, pickle couldn’t read those cached data since protocol 4 was unknown to it, and we were getting some 500s.\nValueError: unsupported pickle protocol: 4 Why This Wasn’t detected Before Deployment Though we had good test coverage, caching scenarios were mocked in the unit tests. The subset of data we used for integration tests didn’t have any unicode entry. We didn’t test manually with unicode data. Hence it caught us off guard!\nHow We Solved the Issue We re-reverted the revert PR, and instantly after the deployment, we deleted the already cached data from redis. Since most of the consumers of that service were kind of background workers with high timeouts, performance spike from the mass cache invalidation didn’t cause much trouble.\nAround 2 years after the incident, when I look back, definitely can realize - this kind of incidents teach us invaluable lessons!\n","description":"","tags":["Python","Flask","cache","redis","pickle"],"title":"Incident on Python 2 to 3 Migration: Redis Cache and Pickle","uri":"/incident-on-python-2-to-3-migration-redis-cache-and-pickle/"},{"categories":["Django","Python"],"content":"More than a year ago I wrote the post: Auto generating unique slug in Django. There we considered a model named Article, which had title and slug fields. We had overridden the save method of that model to automatically save the unique slug which had been generated by our written _get_unique_slug model method. But what will happen if we want to auto generate unique slug for tens or even hundreds of models? Do the same for each of the models? No way! So, in this post, we will know how we can achieve that through a generic approach. To continue reading this post, you don’t necessarily need to read that previous post, but recommended.\nThe Basics What is slug? Consider the URL of this post: /auto-generating-unique-slug-django-generic-approach/ . Here the bold part of the URL is called slug.\nSuppose we have tens of models including the Author:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 from django.db import models class Author(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=120) slug = models.SlugField(max_length=140, unique=True) def __str__(self): return self.name Based on the name filed, slug filed should be generated. If the name of our first Author is ‘John Doe’, the slug should be ‘john-doe’. If the name of our second Author is also ‘John Doe’, the slug should be ‘john-doe-1’. And if the name of our third Author is ‘John Doe’ again, the slug should be ‘john-doe-2’. And so on.\nThe Solution Let’s create a file named utils.py in the app directory and write this code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 from django.utils.text import slugify def get_unique_slug(model_instance, slugable_field_name, slug_field_name): \"\"\" Takes a model instance, sluggable field name (such as 'title') of that model as string, slug field name (such as 'slug') of the model as string; returns a unique slug as string. \"\"\" slug = slugify(getattr(model_instance, slugable_field_name)) unique_slug = slug extension = 1 ModelClass = model_instance.__class__ while ModelClass._default_manager.filter( **{slug_field_name: unique_slug} ).exists(): unique_slug = '{}-{}'.format(slug, extension) extension += 1 return unique_slug As the docstring says, the get_unique_slug takes a django model instance for the first argument, sluggable field name such as ’name’ (based on which the slug will be generated) of that model as string for the second argument and slug field name such as ‘slug’ of the model as string for the third argument. And it returns a unique slug as string.\nLet’s break down the code a bit. At line 10, slugify (django.utils.text.slugify) takes a string like ‘John Doe’ as argument and returns a string like ‘john-doe’. And we are accessing the sluggable field of the model instance using getattr. At line 13, we are getting the model class from the model instance using class.\nTake a closer look at line 15-19. Until we get a unique slug, we append the current slug string with an extension number starting from 1; such as ‘john-doe-1’, ‘john-doe-2’…. For accessing the model manager (usually objects) we are using _default_manager. Line 15 might look a bit tricky, in short, **{slug_field_name: unique_slug} works like something similar to slug='john-doe'. To understand this clearly, we need to know about how **kwargs works in python and how django model unpacks it. As this is beyond the scope of this post, I’m not discussing it here.\nLet’s update our models.py:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 from django.db import models from .utils import get_unique_slug class Author(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=120) slug = models.SlugField(max_length=140, unique=True) def save(self, *args, **kwargs): if not self.slug: self.slug = get_unique_slug(self, 'name', 'slug') super().save(*args, **kwargs) def __str__(self): return self.name Here we are overriding the save method, if the slug is already not set, we are setting it using the get_unique_slug function.\nYou can also consider to use the pre_save signal instead of overriding the save method.\nBoom! all done, enjoy!\n","description":"","tags":["Django","Python","slug"],"title":"Auto generating unique slug in Django: a generic approach","uri":"/auto-generating-unique-slug-django-generic-approach/"},{"categories":["Programming","Python"],"content":"“ডেকরেটর!

So what is slug? Consider the URL of this post: /auto-generating-unique-slug-in-django/ . Here the bold part of the URL is called slug.\nFirst, consider a model Article in which we will generate the unique slug.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 from django.db import models class Article(models.Model): title = models.CharField(max_length=120) slug = models.SlugField(max_length=140, unique=True) content = models.TextField() def __str__(self): return self.title In our model Article we have three fields: title, slug and content. Django provides a built-in model field for slug, SlugField. We will generate the slug based on the title field.\nHow the slug will be generated: If the title of our first article is ‘New article’, the slug will be ’new-article’. If the title of our second article is also ‘New article’, the slug will be ’new-article-1’. And if the title of our third article is ‘New article’ again, the slug will be ’new-article-2’. And so on.\nSo, to do that we have to write code like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 from django.db import models from django.utils.text import slugify class Article(models.Model): title = models.CharField(max_length=120) slug = models.SlugField(max_length=140, unique=True) content = models.TextField() def __str__(self): return self.title def _get_unique_slug(self): slug = slugify(self.title) unique_slug = slug num = 1 while Article.objects.filter(slug=unique_slug).exists(): unique_slug = '{}-{}'.format(slug, num) num += 1 return unique_slug def save(self, *args, **kwargs): if not self.slug: self.slug = self._get_unique_slug() super().save(*args, **kwargs) Look at the line 22, we override the save() method here. If the slug doesn’t already exist in the instance of Article, we generate it by calling _get_unique_slug() method. I am not explaining the code of _get_unique_slug() method in detail because it is kind of self explanatory. But what slugify() does? Well, if we give a string like ‘The new article title’ to slugify(), it returns ’the-new-article-title’. Simple.\nYou can also consider to use the pre_save signal instead of overriding the save method.\nThanks for reading this post. Have a nice day!\nYou should consider to read this post as well: Auto generating unique slug in Django: a generic approach.\n","description":"","tags":["Django","Python","slug"],"title":"Auto generating unique slug in Django","uri":"/auto-generating-unique-slug-in-django/"},{"categories":["Django","Python"],"content":"Django is a popular Python web framework. In this tutorial we are going to create a simple feedback system using Python 3 and Django 1.9. It is assumed that you know the basics of django. If not, then please read the django official tutorial first. It is also assumed that you are using python 3 and django 1.9.x is installed (possibly in a virtual environment) in your computer. In this tutorial we will focus mostly on code. In most of the case, things will not be described in depth, but the documentation link will be provided, so no worry. Ok, let’s start.\nCreating the django project and app Run this command in the terminal/console:\ndjango-admin startproject feedback This will create a directory structure like this:\nfeedback ├── feedback │ ├── __init__.py │ ├── settings.py │ ├── urls.py │ └── wsgi.py └── manage.py Now enter to the project directory by:\ncd feedback Well, now we will create an app named ‘form’:\npython manage.py startapp form This will create the directory structure like this:\nfeedback ├── feedback │ ├── __init__.py │ ├── settings.py │ ├── urls.py │ └── wsgi.py ├── form │ ├── admin.py │ ├── apps.py │ ├── __init__.py │ ├── migrations │ │ └── __init__.py │ ├── models.py │ ├── tests.py │ └── views.py └── manage.py If you know the basics of django, you know what’s going on. If you stuck here, please read the django official tutorial first.\nEnabling the app at settings.py Open the feedback/settings.py file and add ‘form’ in the INSTALLED_APPS list, like this:\n33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 INSTALLED_APPS = [ 'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'form', ] Additionally you can change the time zone from settings.py file. I am setting the time zone from ‘UTC’ to ‘Asia/Dhaka’:\n110 TIME_ZONE = 'Asia/Dhaka' Creating the models Models are the python classes which contain the information about database. Read more about models here. For your information, in this tutorial, we are using SQLite as database backend. It is the default, so no further action is required.\nIn our feedback system, we will receive product based feedback. So there should be products in our database. For simplicity we assume that, our product has only one property, just its name.\nAnd in the feedback form, we want to collect the customer name, email, related product, detailed feedback, is he/she happy or not, and date.\nSo to design the models, open the form/models.py file and add this code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 from django.db import models class Product(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=120) def __str__(self): return self.name class Feedback(models.Model): customer_name = models.CharField(max_length=120) email = models.EmailField() product = models.ForeignKey(Product) details = models.TextField() happy = models.BooleanField() date = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True) def __str__(self): return self.customer_name Now, run this command for making the migrations (database changes):\npython manage.py makemigrations And apply the migrations by this command:\npython manage.py migrate To know the details about migrations, read this.\nEnabling and configuring the admin interface To use the default admin interface provided by django for our models, we need to create the super user first. Run this command to do that:\npython manage.py createsuperuser This will prompt for username, email and password. Provide this.\nNow to enable and to customize the admin interface of our model, open the form/admin.py file and put this code in it:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 from django.contrib import admin from .models import Product, Feedback class FeedbackAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin): list_display = ('product', 'customer_name', 'date', 'happy',) list_filter = ('product', 'date',) search_fields = ('product__name', 'details',) class Meta: model = Feedback admin.site.register(Feedback, FeedbackAdmin) admin.site.register(Product) The details about admin site can be found here.\nNow run this command to start the development server:\npython manage.py runserver Now go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ from your browser, log in and add some products and feedback and check that everything works just fine.\nScreenshot: list of feedback at django admin site\nCreating the view First create a new file at form/forms.py and put this code in it:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 from django import forms from .models import Feedback class FeedbackForm(forms.ModelForm): class Meta: model = Feedback exclude = [] Learn more about forms and model forms.\nNow edit the form/views.py in this way:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 from django.shortcuts import render from .forms import FeedbackForm def feedback_form(request): if request.method == 'POST': form = FeedbackForm(request.POST) if form.is_valid(): form.save() return render(request, 'form/thanks.html') else: form = FeedbackForm() return render(request, 'form/feedback_form.html', {'form': form}) Creating the templates Create a folder named ’templates’ inside the ‘form’ folder. And create another folder named ‘form’ inside the ’templates’ folder. Now create three empty html file named ‘base.html’, ‘feedback_form.html’ and ’thanks.html’ inside the form folder. The directory structure should look like this:\nform ├── templates │ └── form │ ├── base.html │ ├── feedback_form.html │ └── thanks.html Now, open the form/templates/form/base.html file and add this code to it:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003chtml\u003e \u003chead\u003e \u003ctitle\u003e{% block title %}{% endblock %}\u003c/title\u003e \u003c/head\u003e \u003cbody\u003e {% block body %}{% endblock %} \u003c/body\u003e \u003c/html\u003e Open the form/templates/form/feedback_form.html file and add this code to it:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 {% extends 'form/base.html' %} {% block title %}Feedback Form{% endblock %} {% block body %} \u003cform action=\"{% url 'form:home' %}\" method=\"POST\"\u003e {% csrf_token %} {{ form.as_p }} \u003cinput type=\"submit\" /\u003e \u003c/form\u003e {% endblock %} Finally, open the form/templates/form/thanks.html file and add this code to it:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 {% extends 'form/base.html' %} {% block title %}Thanks{% endblock %} {% block body %} \u003ch1\u003eThanks for your response.\u003c/h1\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"{% url 'form:home' %}\"\u003eResponse again?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e {% endblock %} You can learn more about django template language.\nURL configuration Create and open the file form/urls.py and put this code in it:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 from django.conf.urls import url from . import views app_name = 'form' urlpatterns = [ url(r'^$', views.feedback_form, name='home'), ] Now, edit the feedback/urls.py if like this way:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 from django.conf.urls import include, url from django.contrib import admin urlpatterns = [ url(r'^', include('form.urls')), url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls), ] You can learn more about django URL dispatcher.\nConclusion All done! Now fire up the django development server by this command:\npython manage.py runserver Now go to **http://127.0.0.1:8000/ **from your browser.

While I am writing this post, no better title is coming to my mind.\nBy the way, let me explain the topic. Suppose you have installed WordPress in the XAMPP stack in Ubuntu (or any other ubuntu based distro). Now you want to install some plugins and themes from the WordPress dashboard. You have clicked on the “Install Now” button and suddenly this ugly(!) message comes in front of you, asking for your FTP credentials.\nBut it should not happen. So you start searching in the internet how to fix this problem. In the maximum solution, you have been told to input your FTP credentials or add them to the wp-config.php file. But it can be solved in a different way.\nActually if the user of WordPress installation directory is different from the user of apache, this problem happens. So we need to fix this.\nFirstly, we need to check the user of apache. To do this, run the following command in terminal:\nps -ef | grep httpd | grep -v `whoami` | grep -v root | head -n1 | awk '{print $1}' In my case, the user of apache is “daemon”.\nSo we need to change the user and group of WordPress installation directory to “daemon”. To do this, run the following command in terminal:\nsudo chown -R daemon:daemon /opt/lampp/htdocs/wordpress/ Replace daemon:daemon with your apache user:group (you have got this by running the firstly mentioned command). Replace /opt/lampp/htdocs/wordpress/ with your WordPress directory location.\nBoom!!! Done!!!\nSo by now you can install themes and plugins and can update them without your FTP credentials. Congratulation!\nIf you find this post helpful, please do share and subscribe to this blog by your email. And obviously feel free to share your thoughts in the comment section.
